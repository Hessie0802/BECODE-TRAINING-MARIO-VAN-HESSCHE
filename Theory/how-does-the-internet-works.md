# **How does the internet works?** #

The internet is about:
- Wire
- Clients
- Servers
- IP-addresses
- Sending Packages


## Wire ##
1. The internet is not a bubble Cloud
2. The internet is a wire

## Clients/Servers ##
 *1. Two computers (Servers) are connected with each other through the wire.*
Every server has a unique ***IP-address***. These IP-addresse finds each other.
Those Ip-addresses have a name e.g. google.com*

*2. We called the servers like our a computer or mobile phone a ***client***.*

*3. My  client (the computer) will go through an ***Internet Service Provider*** to communicate with e.g. google.com*

## Diffent Packages ##

- When we want to send an email, my client will communicate to e.g. aol.com and go to different servers to get the postbox of my aunt e.g. From my aunt's postbox there will be returning different different packages to my email postbox to receive an email.

- Everything goes about routers, each router has an IP-address so that there can be no mistakes to receive somthing that wasn't ment to send.
